Eraser Bot Frontend v1.2 Source Code

The code builds in VC# 2008, uses .NET 2.0. It will not run in Linux without
some tweaking, might be a nice side project.

Note that this software doesn't include eraser bot. Eraser bot ships with a bot configuration
file setup to make use of the kw skin pack. You'll be needing that also, otherwise
the bots in team-based games won't be appear as they should - females appear as males, yada yada.

Eraser bot can be found here (grab eraser.zip): https://code.google.com/p/eraser-bot-frontend/downloads/list
kw skin pack can be found here: http://quake2.radiac.net/downloads/skins.html

Both eraser bot and the kw skin pack are not mine. Just want to make that clear.
