Eraser Bot Frontend v1.2 Source Code

The code builds in VC# 2008 and uses .NET 2.0.

The latest, usable version of the software lives in the "builds" directory; it includes
a zip of the eraser bot itself and the kw skin pack, if needed. Without the skin pack installed, 
the bots in team-based games won't be appear as they should; females appear as males, yada yada.

Both eraser bot and the kw skin pack are not mine. Just want to make that clear.

Screenshots are in the wiki.
