Eraser Bot Frontend v1.3 Source Code


Both eraser bot and the kw skin pack are not mine. Just want to make that clear.

To rebuild from source code, you'll need the IrrlichLime assembly and Irrlicht itself; you'll find them
in the either a zipped build or in the repo's bin directory.

Screenshots are in the wiki.
