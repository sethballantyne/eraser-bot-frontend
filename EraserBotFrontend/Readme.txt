Eraser Bot Frontend 1.2

Introduction
------------
Eraser bot Frontend is a .NET application that acts as a GUI for Quake II's
Eraser bot modification. EBF is largely inspired by the dated but great Quick Start Eraser
Bot wizard created way back in the '90s. I created this for my own personal use, 
but hopefully someone else finds it useful as well.

The current version only supports Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch. CTF support will be added
in a future release, as will the ability to create and modify bots and DM teams.

EBF is free, opensource software. You can modify it and distribute it to your hearts content provided
you adhere to the license. See license.txt for details.

Requirements
------------
Windows 2000 or later
Microsoft's .NET Framework v2.0 or later*
Quake II patched to 3.20
Eraser Bot 1.01 

*Mono may work, I haven't tested it.

Installation
------------
Extract and run.
When you run the software for the first time you'll be prompted to set
the paths for Quake II and Eraser bot. You can keep running the software
if you fail to do this, but you won't be able to do hell of a lot.
